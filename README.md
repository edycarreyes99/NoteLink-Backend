## Description

Backend service for the NoteLink project.

## Installation

**You're going to need yarn. You can install it by run `npm i -g yarn`. Is preferred to use node.js v16.13.0** Then, you
can run the code:

## Running the app

To run the app locally, first you need to have set up the environment variables and the database. The unique environment
file that you need to serve the app without problems is the `.env` file. Then you can run the following code to start
the application:

```

## Info

This project was thinking to be very scalable, so it's divided in modules. Each module has its own controllers,
services, and other stuffs that are related to it. I use swagger to document the API, so you can check the documentation
on the `/api` route.
